2014 [ILSVRC](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/) ([ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge) <b>Winner</b>.

It is a benchmark competition where teams across the world compete to classify, localize, detect ... images of 1000 categories, taken from the imagenet dataset.The imagenet dataset holds 15M images of 22K categories but for this contest: 1.2M images in 1K categories were chosen.Their goal was, Classification i.e, make 5 guesses about label for an image.Team " GoogLeNet ", achieved top 5 test error rate of 6.7%. It was a better than any other model's performance at that time. Check ILSVRC 2014 [results](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/results).

This paper is important as it is one of the first CNN architectures that really strayed from the general approach of simply stacking conv and pooling layers on top of each other in a sequential structure.The authors of the paper also emphasized that this new model places notable consideration on memory and power usage.

Overview
-
When we first take a look at the structure of GoogLeNet ( above gif ), we notice immediately that not everything is happening sequentially, as seen in previous architectures. We have pieces of the network that are happening in parallel as well. 'GoogLeNet' is a 22 layer deep Convolutional Neural Network architecture with computational efficiency, introduced in 2014 by [Christian Szegedy](https://research.google.com/pubs/ChristianSzegedy.html), [Wei Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yFMX138AAAAJ), [Yangqing Jia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mu5Y2rYAAAAJ), [Pierre Sermanet](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0nPi5YYAAAAJ), [Scott Reed](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jEANvfgAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dragomir Anguelov](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/a/Anguelov:Dragomir), [Dumitru Erhan](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=wfGiqXEAAAAJ&hl=en), [Vincent Vanhoucke](https://research.google.com/pubs/VincentVanhoucke.html) and [Andrew Rabinovich](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=qn1ejaQAAAAJ&hl=en)
